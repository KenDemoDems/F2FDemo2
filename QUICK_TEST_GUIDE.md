# Quick Test Guide - Navigation Persistence

## What Was Fixed

- ✅ Recipes now appear in MealPlanPage when generated in HomePage
- ✅ **Recipes/ingredients NO LONGER DISAPPEAR when navigating back to HomePage**
- ✅ Can navigate between all pages without losing data

## Test Steps

### 1. Generate Recipes Flow

```
1. Login to your account
2. Upload a fridge image OR click "Generate Recipe" button
3. Wait for recipes to appear in HomePage
4. ✅ Verify: Recipes displayed with ingredients
```

### 2. Navigate to Meal Plan

```
1. From HomePage (with recipes visible)
2. Click "Meal Plan" in navbar
3. Click "+ Add Breakfast" or "+ Add Lunch" or "+ Add Dinner"
4. ✅ Verify: Dialog shows your generated recipes (not just 3 hardcoded ones)
5. Select a recipe and assign it
6. ✅ Verify: Recipe appears in the meal slot
```

### 3. Navigate Back to HomePage (THE KEY TEST)

```
1. From Meal Plan page
2. Click "Home" in navbar
3. ✅ Verify: Your ingredients are still visible
4. ✅ Verify: Your generated recipes are still displayed
5. ✅ Verify: NO "Loading..." message
6. ✅ Verify: NO empty state
```

### 4. Navigate to Meal Plan Again

```
1. From HomePage (recipes still visible)
2. Click "Meal Plan" in navbar
3. Click "+ Add Breakfast" on a different day
4. ✅ Verify: SAME recipes still available in dialog
5. ✅ Verify: Can assign more meals
```

### 5. Navigate to Inventory and Back

```
1. Click "Inventory" in navbar
2. ✅ Verify: Ingredients visible in inventory
3. Click "Home" in navbar
4. ✅ Verify: Recipes/ingredients STILL there
```

### 6. Full Navigation Loop

```
Home → Meal Plan → Inventory → About → Home
✅ At each step, data should persist
✅ When back at Home, everything should still be visible
```

## What to Look For in Browser Console

Open DevTools Console (F12) and watch for these logs:

### On Login:

```
App: loaded shared recipes from Firebase: X
App: loaded shared ingredients from Firebase: Y
```

### On HomePage:

```
(No "Loading your data..." message)
(Recipes render immediately)
```

### On Navigate to MealPlan:

```
MealPlanPage: received recipes count = X
```

### On Assign Meal:

```
MealPlan: assigned [Recipe Name] to [Day] [Meal Type]
```

### On Navigate Back to HomePage:

```
(No Firebase fetch logs)
(No state reset)
(Recipes render from existing App.tsx state)
```

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ CORRECT (After Fix):

- Generate recipes → see 10+ recipes
- Go to Meal Plan → can select from all 10+ recipes
- Go back to Home → **all recipes still there**
- Go to Meal Plan → **all recipes still available**
- Navigate anywhere → **data never disappears**

### ❌ BROKEN (Before Fix):

- Generate recipes → see 10+ recipes
- Go to Meal Plan → can select from all 10+ recipes ✅
- Go back to Home → **recipes disappear!** ❌
- Go to Meal Plan → **only 3 hardcoded recipes** ❌

## Troubleshooting

### If recipes still disappear:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify you're logged in
3. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Check Network tab for repeated Firebase fetches

### If MealPlan shows no recipes:

1. Verify recipes were generated in HomePage first
2. Check console: "MealPlanPage: received recipes count = 0" means data not passed
3. Check console for "App: loaded shared recipes from Firebase" log

### If build fails:

1. Run: `npm run build`
2. Check for TypeScript errors
3. Verify all files saved

## Technical Changes Summary

- **HomePage.tsx**: Removed duplicate state, uses shared props directly
- **App.tsx**: No changes (already manages shared state correctly)
- **MealPlanPage.tsx**: No changes (already receives recipes prop)

## Files to Check

- `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` - Main fix applied here
- `src/App.tsx` - Verify shared state is passed
- `src/pages/MealPlanPage.tsx` - Should receive recipes prop
